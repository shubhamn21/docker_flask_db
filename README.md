# Dockerising a Flask micro-framework API

## The Flask API

In this project, I set out to create a web API that will create, update, delete and edit datalists.
The API is deveoped in flask with help from FlaskRestful.


## Installation and Setup.
Assuming you have docker and docker compose are installed already locally. But if you do not,
Once installed, please run 'build.sh' to get the containers up and running

Check sample's folder to see how to use the scripts to play around with API.
